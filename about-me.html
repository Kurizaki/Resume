                <h2>Hello, It's me Keanu!</h2>
                <p>Greetings! Welcome to my About Me page, where you'll get to know some fascinating details about me. I go by the name Keanu Maleeq Koelewijn, and at the age of 17, I'm filled with enthusiasm and a zest for life. Mark your calendars because I entered this world on December 2, 2005. </p>
                <p>Now, let's rewind a bit. It was during my 11th year on this spinning blue marble when I discovered my undying love for computer science and I set my sights on becoming a computer scientist. Recently, I've had the privilege of gaining experiences in the field through Computer Science Middle School, where I'm studying computer science. Technology has always captivated my interest, even from a young age.</p>
                <p>Primary school, if my memory serves me right, presented its fair share of challenges. Moving to a new location meant starting everything from scratch, and that wasn't easy. However, as I transitioned to secondary school at Realschule (lowest type of secondary school in Switzerland), things became smoother for me. This led my parents to realize that I wasn't being adequately challenged. They approached the school administration, advocating for me to be placed in a more demanding educational environment. As a result, after completing the second year at Realschule, I moved up to the Sekundarstufe (middle type of secondary school in Switzerland), which entailed repeating a year. Adapting to a new class and a faster pace initially posed difficulties, but I quickly acclimated.</p>
                <p>Even as I neared the end of my secondary school journey, I still hadn't decided which apprenticeship path to pursue. None of them seemed appealing except for becoming a computer scientist, but I doubted my ability to achieve that dream. However, my love for learning propelled me to dedicate extra effort in my final year, striving for excellent grades that would meet the requirements for admission to the Computer Science Middle School (5.3 GPA). Miraculously, I attained it in the first semester, and though I fell just 0.1 below the requirement in the second semester, I was provisionally accepted.</p>
                <p>The Computer Science Middle School has been a rewarding yet challenging experience for me. After years of feeling underchallenged in previous educational settings, I had to catch up on the material covered by my peers from the Bezirksschule (highest type of secondary school in Switzerland). The workload demanded significant effort and dedication. Finally, at the end of the first semester, I received the official acceptance letter, solidifying my place in the apprenticeship. Currently, I devote over 40 hours a week to school and even spend my free time at home working on schoolwork.</p>
                <p>I'm incredibly content at the Computer Science Middle School because I'm pursuing my passion for computer science while being continuously challenged. The high stakes of potentially being expelled for poor grades keep me motivated to excel and strive for excellence.</p>

                <h3>Volleyball</h3>
                <img class="hobby-image" src="pics/WhatsApp Image 2023-07-04 at 10.25.08.jpeg" alt="Keanu playing Volleyball">
                <p>Over the past three years, volleyball has become an integral part of my life. It all started with regular games, but during the pandemic, my friends and I took our passion for volleyball to the next level. We aimed to become the best and decided to establish a volleyball extracurricular activity at our school. Gathering enough interested members, we embarked on this exciting journey together. Additionally, I joined VBC Kanti Baden, a club dedicated to volleyball. I must admit, I struggled initially, but with time and perseverance, I started improving my skills. Participating in various tournaments brought me immense joy, and I relished the competitive atmosphere. I even managed to progress through 2-3 leagues, which was a testament to my dedication and hard work.

                    However, as I began my studies at the vocational school for computer science, I faced a setback due to an injury. Conversations with my coach led us to a joint decision: it was best for me to take a temporary break from the team to focus on recovering from my injury and prioritize my academic commitments. During that period, volleyball no longer brought me the same level of joy as before. It was a challenging time, but I understood the importance of prioritizing my well-being and academic progress.
                    
                    After a six-month hiatus, I felt a longing to return to the volleyball court. I decided to attend a trial training session at a smaller mixed volleyball club, which happened to be closer to my home. The experience reignited my passion for the sport, filling me with incredible joy once again. Joining the team at STV Turgi has been a delightful journey for me, and I have been actively playing for almost half a year now. Unfortunately, a recent foot injury has temporarily kept me away from the game for the past month. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic and eagerly anticipate the day when I can lace up my shoes and get back on the court, ready to embrace the exhilaration of volleyball once more.</p>
