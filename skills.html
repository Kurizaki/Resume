                <p>Throughout my journey, I have gained valuable experience in various programming languages, including C#, HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, Java (specifically, Robocode), PowerShell, and GitHub. While my expertise primarily lies in C#, HTML, and CSS, I am proficient in the others as well. I acquired foundational knowledge of these languages either through formal education or self-study. Currently, my favorite language is C#, perhaps because it was my starting point and the one in which I have the most experience. However, my hunger for knowledge pushes me to continually explore and master new programming languages and tools, seeking to enhance my coding experience.</p>

                <p>As a Dutch native living in Switzerland, I am fluent in both Dutch and Swiss German, thanks to my upbringing. However, I must admit that my written Dutch skills are not as refined as my spoken language skills, as I primarily learned to communicate in Dutch within the confines of my home. On the other hand, I have been learning English for nine years, and I am confident in my ability to comprehend and express myself fluently. I consider myself proficient in English. Additionally, I have been studying French for six years at school, although I currently classify myself as a beginner, as I still have much to learn and improve. Despite my less-than-perfect French, I am determined to enhance my proficiency in the language. Furthermore, I have recently embarked on learning Japanese, a language I find fascinating and have developed a passion for. I have even had the pleasure of making Japanese friends along the way, which adds an extra level of excitement to my language learning journey.</p>

                <p>Let's talk about those certificates, shall we? They are a testament to my remarkable skills and competence. Seriously, they are impressive! Who doesn't love a solid demonstration of teamwork and collaboration? And don't get me started on that eye-catching certificate from DO (Violence Prevention); it's enough to make any employer weak at the knees. If you're an employer who appreciates exceptional talent, go ahead and click that little button in the bottom-right corner to send me a message. Who knows? Maybe one day, I'll be working for you, making magic happen together.</p>
